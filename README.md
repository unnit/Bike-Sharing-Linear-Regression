# Linear Regression on Bike Sharing Dataset

### Project Steps:
1.Data Cleanup and Formatting – Handling missing values, correcting data types, and renaming columns for consistency.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding data distributions, trends, and relationships using visualizations and summary statistics.
3.Data Preparation – Feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as needed.
4.Train-Test Split – Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
5.Model Building with Statsmodels – Applying Linear Regression using the statsmodels package and interpreting model output.
